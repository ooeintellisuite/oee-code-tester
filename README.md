Created a CLI tool that allows you to run checks using a configuration file against the developers codebase. This configuration file can be customized by enabling/disabling rules and adding/removing dependencies. 

There are two ways to run the checks. 

1. node devTool.js
2. Vitest Extension

checkCodeQuality.js is a solution that runs automatically when using git pre-commit hooks. 

Make sure to npm install before using.
