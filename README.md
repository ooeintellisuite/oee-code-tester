Created a CLI tool that allows you to run checks using a configuration file against the developers codebase. This configuration file can be customized by enabling/disabling rules and adding/removing dependencies.

This is a way to run the checks.

1. npx ts-node devTool.ts

Make sure to npm install before using.

This is a way to run the unit tests for devTool.ts.

npx vitest tests/ or npx vitest tests/checkGitignore.test.ts
